      <h2>Favorite Quotes</h2>
      <p>
        I learned this quote while working at Blue Cross&#47;Blue Shield. We placed it on trainees&#39; desks on the first day of training.<br>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <q>Why should I memorize something that I can look up in a book.</q> <cite>Albert Einstein</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I love this quote, because I love learning by doing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <q>Apply yourself. Get all the education you can, but then, by God, do something. Don't just stand there, make it happen.</q> <cite>Lee Iacocca</cite>
